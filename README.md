## Disabling Caching
Sometimes changes aren't reflected due to browser caching, but caching can be disabled. 

For Chrome:
1. Open Chrome Devtools (Right-click > `Inspect`)
2. Click `Network` in top toolbar to open the network pane
3. Check the `Disable cache` checkbox (might have to make the devtool pane wider to see the option)

Note that this setting is active only while the devtools are open.
